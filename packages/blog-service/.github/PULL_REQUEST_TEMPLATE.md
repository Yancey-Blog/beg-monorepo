3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!

4. Ensure the test suite passes (yarn test). Tip: yarn test --watch TestName is helpful in development.

5. Run yarn test:cov to generate coverage report. It supports the same options as yarn test.

6. If you need a debugger, run yarn test:debug TestName, open chrome://inspect, and press "Inspect".

7. Format your code with prettier (yarn prettier).

8. Make sure your code lints (yarn lint). Tip: yarn lint to only check changed files.
